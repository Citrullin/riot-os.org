### Building
Make sure you have Jekyll and Bundle installed (see https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

Run `jekyll build`. This will create a directory `_site`. To watch for file
changes and trigger a rebuild, you can run `jekyll build --watch`.

Serve the website running `jekyll serve --livereload`.
